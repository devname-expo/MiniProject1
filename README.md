# MiniProject1
A program that identifies the largest target value that cannot be exactly achieved from a given combination of specified integer inputs. This solution is designed to support inventory and resource allocation scenarios, where limited package sizes or units create unfulfillable order sizes. 

## Quick Start

To run the project with example data, run the following:
```bash
python src/app.py --units "5,8,9"
```

```bash
python src/app.py --file 'docs/test_cases.csv'
```
